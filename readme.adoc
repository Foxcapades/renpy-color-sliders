== Customization

You may be looking at this thing and thinking "wow, that's kinda ugly," which is
probably true.  I don't have an eye for design, and I don't pretend to, but
luckily the link:game/lib/fxcpds/color_picker/screens/screen_color_picker.rpy[color picker screen]
and link:game/lib/fxcpds/color_picker/screens/styles.rpy[its styles] are pretty
simple and easily hackable.
